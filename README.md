# Project: Study of a microglia-specific eQTL
## Authors: Rebekah Langston and J. Raph Gibbs


This repository contains scripts used to produce the results presented in our manuscript titled "Association of a Common Genetic Variant with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease is Propagated through Microglia".

## Seven datasets are analyzed:
1. Single nuclei RNA sequencing of human frontal cortex
1. Single cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived microglia
1. Target mRNA and protein expression in iPSC-derived microglia
1. Single nuclei ATAC sequencing of human frontal cortex
2. Single nuclei Multiome (RNA + ATAC) sequencing of human substantia nigra
3. Bulk ATAC sequencing of iPSC-derived cells
4. Single cell CRISPRi screen in iPSC-derived microglia targeting LRRK2 CREs
