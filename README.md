# Project: Study of a microglia-specific eQTL
## Author: Rebekah Langston


This repository contains R and command line scripts used to produce the results presented in our manuscript titled "Association of a common genetic variant with Parkinson's Disease is driven by microglia-specific modulation of LRRK2 expression".

## Six datasets are analyzed:
1. Single nuclei RNA sequencing of human frontal cortex
1. Single cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived microglia
1. Target mRNA and protein expression in iPSC-derived microglia
1. Single nuclei ATAC sequencing of human frontal cortex
1. Bulk ATAC sequencing of iPSC-derived cells
1. Single-cell RNA sequening of iPSC-derived microglia and CRISPR-dcas9 of LRRK2 CREs
