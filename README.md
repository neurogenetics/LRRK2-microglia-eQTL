# Project: Study of a microglia-specific eQTL
## Authors: Rebekah Langston and J. Raph Gibbs


This repository contains scripts used to produce the results presented in our manuscript titled "Association of a Common Genetic Variant with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease is Propagated through Microglia".

## These datasets are analyzed:
* Single nuclei RNA sequencing of human frontal cortex
* Single cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived microglia
* Target mRNA and protein expression in iPSC-derived microglia
* Single nuclei ATAC sequencing of human frontal cortex
* Single nuclei Multiome (GEX + ATAC) sequencing of human substantia nigra
  * Also analysis of publicly available human substantia nigra snRNAseq datasets   
* Bulk ATAC sequencing of iPSC-derived cells
  * Also integration of bulk ATACseq and snATACseq datasets   
* Single cell CRISPRi screen in iPSC-derived microglia targeting LRRK2 CREs
