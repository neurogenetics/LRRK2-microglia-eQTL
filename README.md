# LRRK2-microglia-eQTL

## This repository contains R and command line scripts used to produce the results presented in our manuscript titled "Association of a common genetic variant with Parkinson's Disease is driven by microglia-specific modulation of LRRK2 expression".

## Four datasets are analyzed:
### 1.  Single nuclei RNA sequencing of human frontal cortex
### 2.  Single cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived microglia
### 3.  Single nuclei ATAC sequencing of human frontal cortex
### 4.  Bulk ATAC sequencing of iPSC-derived cells
